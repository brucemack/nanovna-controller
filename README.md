NanoVNA Technial Information
============================
The data command returns a list of reflection coefficients in real/imaginary pairs.  Each line contains one coefficient and the real/imaginary parts are space-delimited.

Gamma is the magnitude of the complex reflect coefficient.

VSWR = (1+Gamma)/(1-Gamma)
